What I have learned:

1. Using 3 fully connected layers improved the model.

2. After training for 5 epochs, train accuracy = 90.86% and test accuracy = 88.99%.       Training time = 3.85 minutes
   Using regularization dropout layer (p=0.15) and weight_decay = 1e-4, train accuracy =       89.47% and test accuracy = 88.05%. Training time = 4.94 minutes

3. Padding

4. Regularization like dropout and weight decay

5. pytorch libraries

6. Create CNN model using pytorch

7. After training for 10 epochs, train accuracy = 92.90% and test accuracy = 90.42%. Training time = 8.19 minutes
   Using regularization dropout layer (p=0.15) and weight_decay = 1e-4, train accuracy = 90.91% and test accuracy = 87.9%. Training time = 10.26. minutes


Problems:
1. Had trouble understanding the dimension of convolution and pooling layers, documentation and some yt tutorial videos were helpful.

2. Model didn't converge after 5 epochs so had to increase epochs.
