Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning which deals with on-flight control to maximise certain reward. It's a blend of traditional Machine Learning methods and Optimal Control. Reinforcement Learning is about training an agent, our model, to interact with an environment, know about its state and then performed the best possible actions to maximise our long-term reward. The best part about RL is that it assumes no specific mathematical model for the environment and learns everything about it by exploring.\r\nCombining the recent surge of RL with the rising popularity of NLP. Our project aims to use RL techniques to improve NLP agents in whatever task they\u2019re performing(ex: text summarisation, dialogue chatbots, generative agents, etc.)\r\n\r\nBuckle up for some intense math (patience needed for understanding RL at first) and coding ofcourse :)",

It goes beyond simple speech recognition by capturing the tone, energy, and other acoustic properties of speech. Scientists use various audio processing techniques to extract features from speech, such as Mel Spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). Commonly used models for SER include RNNs/LSTMs and CNNs, which are trained to classify emotions based on these features. SER finds applications in various fields, including online learning, HR for candidate evaluation, and call centers for customer service improvement. Common datasets for SER practice include the RAVDESS dataset and TESS dataset. Building SER models typically involves data preprocessing, model architecture design (such as CNN-LSTM), training, and testing. Potential project ideas related to SER include building conversational chatbots, mood-based music recommendation engines, and personalized voice recognition systems.\nReference: https://www.projectpro.io/article/speech-emotion-recognition-project-using-machine-learning/573\nGithub: https://github.com/siddugithubb/-SpeechEmotionRecognition_Realtime\n",

We will be implementing the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), a popular, powerful, and especially nimble network for this task. There are some important steps that will be carried out in this project and have been listed below : \nSingle-Shot Detection: A region proposal network that performs object localization and a classifier for detecting the types of objects in the proposed regions.\n\nMultiscale Feature Maps. In image classification tasks, we base our predictions on the final convolutional feature map \u2013 the smallest but deepest representation of the original image. In object detection, feature maps from intermediate convolutional layers can also be directly useful because they represent the original image at different scales.\n\nPriors. These are pre-computed boxes defined at specific positions on specific feature maps, with specific aspect ratios and scales.\n\nMultibox. This is a technique that formulates predicting an object's bounding box as a regression problem, wherein a detected object's coordinates are regressed to its ground truth's coordinates. In addition, for each predicted box, scores are generated for various object types.\n\nNon-Maximum Suppression. At any given location, multiple priors can overlap significantly. Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is a means to remove redundant predictions by suppressing all but the one with the maximum score.",

Imagine if we could extract the power of flight from birds or the resilience of marine life to navigate the depths of the oceans. Similarly, it is possible to transfer features from one image to another to enrich their artistic design using a concept called Neural style transfer (NST).\nCurrently, Neural style transfer (NST) is used by technical team of film and animation production to create stylized visual effects, enhancing scenes with unique artistic interpretations. It is also used by Game developers to generate or enhance environment more relevant to their theme. Additionally, it allows game developers to experiment with different visual styles and themes.\nIn this project, we'll delve into the fundamentals of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), guiding you through the implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for feature extraction and transfer learning. By the end of this project, you'll have gained a strong understanding of ML and DL principles, you will have trained and used neural networks for tasks such as image classification. Additionally, getting exposure to advanced techniques like transfer learning, enabling you to fine-tune pre-trained models to suit your specific dataset.

Techniques such as Gaussian blurring and edge detection (e.g., using Canny edge detector) may be employed.\r\n\r\nEdge Detection: Once the preprocessing is complete, the next step involves detecting prominent edges in the image. Edges are important for defining the outlines and features of objects in the cartoonized image. Techniques like Sobel or Prewitt operators may be used for edge detection.\r\n\r\nColor Reduction: To achieve the characteristic flat and vibrant colors seen in cartoons, the color palette of the image is simplified. This can be done using techniques like color quantization or clustering algorithms such as k-means clustering, where similar colors are grouped together.\r\n\r\nApplying Cartoon Effects: After simplifying the color palette, the cartoon effect is applied to the image. This typically involves combining the simplified colors with the detected edges. One common approach is to overlay the simplified colors onto the edges, giving the appearance of hand-drawn strokes.\r\n\r\nOptional Enhancements: Depending on the desired output, additional enhancements may be applied. These could include adding texture to the colors, adjusting brightness and contrast, or applying artistic filters to further stylize the image.\r\n\r\nOutput Generation: Finally, the processed image is generated and saved or displayed to the user.\r\n\r\nThe project can be implemented using programming languages like Python, leveraging libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and scikit-learn for clustering algorithms.

In the age of self-driving cars, would you trust an ML model with your life? A popular, albeit dramatic, question is if you believe that no robot uprising is possible in the days to come? :)\n\nThe pervasive question still stands; where do you draw the line? How confident are you that nothing \"wrong\" will happen? Would you bet your life on it?\n\nThis brings us to today; we stand in a day and age where the power of AIML seems endless. But with endless power, comes endless responsibility. In this project, we will explore the recent advances in providing guarantees relating to neural networks. We will build a framework to identify potential failures of some simple neural networks. Finally, we will work on making these simple neural networks more robust to various kinds of failure.\n\nIn terms of outcome, you will receive exposure to basic machine learning and artificial intelligence. Additionally, you will experience working with formal methods. More importantly, you will be exposed to some of the latest ideas in a very unique and relevant frontier of computer science.

With models like GPT-3.5 boasting a staggering 175 billion tokens, the sheer scale of these architectures has opened new horizons for AI-driven language understanding. However, as transformer models have grown in size, so too has the demand for more efficient fine-tuning methods. Traditional fine-tuning approaches may struggle to cope with the immense complexity of these large-scale models. In response, innovative techniques like Prefix Tuning have emerged, offering a promising avenue to enhance model performance without compromising efficiency.

That was the inspiration for this idea.\n\nSince the rubicks cube is a huge state space with sparse rewards, we use an algorithm called Autodidactic iteration (ADI) to train a joint value and policy network. The targets seek to estimate the optimal value function by performing a breadth-first search from each input state and use the current network to estimate the values of each of the leafs in the tree. updated values for the root nodes are obtained by recursively backing up the values of each node using a max operator. This algorithm is to train the model/ estimate the value function. We then use search algorithms like A* or MCTS to find the optimal path from the start state to the goal state. which will act as the solver. \n\n3x3x3 cube demonstration: https://deepcube.igb.uci.edu/.\nresearch paper to implement: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07470.pdf\nproject already implemented for 2x2 cube: https://github.com/Debdut/dl-rubiks-autodidactic-solver?tab=readme-ov-file",

We use it in different areas like keeping an eye on how people see brands, helping customers when they have questions or complaints, and even in finance to see how people's feelings and choices affect the stock market.\n\nDuring this project, we'll cover all the important stuff in machine learning. We'll provide you with articles/blogs, videos, and Jupyter/Colab notebooks each week to help you learn. You'll also have weekly assignments (theory + code) to make sure you're learning. Don't worry, though\u2014the assignments will be easy if you've gone through all the resources for that week. You can find more details in the weekly schedule.",

This involves handling missing values, normalizing or scaling the data, and possibly transforming it into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.\r\n\r\nFeature Selection/Engineering: In this phase, relevant features are selected or engineered from the data. For Bitcoin price prediction, features could include technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, relative strength index), sentiment analysis of news articles or social media, and macroeconomic indicators (e.g., inflation rates, stock market performance).\r\n\r\nModel Selection: Various machine learning models can be used for price prediction, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The choice of model depends on factors like the complexity of the data and the desired accuracy.\r\n\r\nTraining and Testing: The selected model is trained on historical data, where it learns patterns and relationships between features and Bitcoin prices. The model's performance is then evaluated using testing data to assess its predictive accuracy.\r\n\r\nHyperparameter Tuning: Machine learning models often have hyperparameters that need to be tuned to optimize performance.

N-armed bandits: Perhaps the simplest RL challenge. You are provided with n arms, and you can pull one of them at a time. Each arm gives a reward from a probability distribution, independent of which arms you pulled beforehand (However it may depend on the time step you pull). Your task is to maximize the sum of these rewards, that is essentially find the arm which gives the maximum expected reward. We will be studying few algorithms to solve this problem.\r\n2. Formalism of Reinforcement Learning in terms of Markov Decision Process: Way to generalise and represent a given problem as a Reinforcement Learning problem.\r\n3. Dynamic Programming: The most basic set of algorithms to deal with prediction and control problems, that is, finding an optimal policy given the complete Markov Decision\u00a0Process\r\n\r\nWeek 3-Monte Carlo Methods,Temporal Difference Learning\r\nPart I is on implementing the Monte Carlo ES algorithm for a given MDP. I've provided the MDP as a Linux executable. If it doesn't run on your device please let me know, and I will share another executable. \r\n\r\nPart II is on solving the game of Tic Tac Toe. Tic Tac Toe can be solved exactly via the minimax algorithm, and in Part I you will have to implement this algorithm. However, you will see that this algorithm is extremely computationally expensive. Therefore we will use an on policy RL algorithm (we will use an algorithm based on \u03b5-soft policies).\r\n\r\nWeek 4-DDQN\r\nReading chapters grookings and implementing\r\n\r\nWeek 5 and 6- Implementing a paper to create a Chess Engine based\u00a0on\u00a0Deep\u00a0RL\r\nImplement the paper.",

Examples include the Travelling Salesman Problem, Maximal Independent Set in graphs, Dominating Set problem, etc.  Learning to solve combinatorial optimisation is very suited for RL-based techniques owing to formulating a CO-based problem as a decision problem. However, we have a non-Markovian decision problem at hand. Monte Carlo Tree Search comes into play to combat this issue. We will explore this domain and look to obtain improved baselines and come up with better algorithms(and implement them, obviously!) by combining MCTS and policy gradient-based methods.

Reinforcement Learning teaches AI agents to perform better based on feedback from their past performance - a technique that has given birth to superhuman intelligence in chess and has mastered self-driving vehicles. Safe to say, it's all the buzz in today's AI landscape! In this project, we will aim to apply RL methods to train an AI to play Doom [1993 GBA], which will hopefully illustrate the sheer robotic power vested in the laptop in your bag.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want a flavour of RL, I recommend you watch the video lecture 1 in the link below.\r\n \r\n\r\nTakeaways from this project:\r\n- Understanding RL algorithms and the sound mathematical basis they are grounded in\r\n- Setting up scalable ML projects, moving them around and building on top of Open-Source projects (you might underestimate the value of this point, but this will make you a pro!)\r\n- Being able to code your own neural networks\r\n- You create an AI agent that kills demons >:)\r\n- A look at the current work in RL and where you could go from here\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a wise programmer once said, \"ML is 2% coding and 98% debugging\". You'll learn to handle frustrating errors and you'll master the art of deftly tuning hyperparameters to extract maximum benefits from your AI agent. All while actually learning something that's meaningful and widely in demand. You'll gain the most if you're a beginner in Reinforcement Learning or have no knowledge of this domain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor theory, we will follow the following sources:\r\nTextbook: https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf\r\nVideo Lectures: https://youtu.be/2pWv7GOvuf0?si=gzh3qQVcJt8OIHVT\r\n\r\n\r\nCoding tasks will be based on the theory covered during the week.\r\nThere are 7 theory goals, one each week and 5 coding skill checkpoints.",

Once a melody is generated, we will analyse it and make alterations to increase the coherency and aesthetics of the music generated.\r\n\r\nOnce we have a decent melody, if time permits, we will use mir (music information retrieval) techniques to track tempo and beat onsets.

This project aims to provide you with the essential tools to begin exploring the world of CV.\r\n\r\nThe project is divided into two phases. The first month will focus on Image processing. Initially, we will cover the basics of Fourier transformation and gradually advance towards understanding spatial-temporal filters, hybridization of images and multi-scale pyramids. \r\nThe second phase encompasses digital video processing. We'll explore and implement Motion Magnification\u2014a technique that enhances subtle motions in video sequences, making them more visible to the human eye.\r\n\r\nAll programming will be done in Python using libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV (cv2), and SciPy. (don't worry if you are hearing these names for the first time, we will provide you tutorial for every library :) ). You'll have access to ample resources and sufficient time to complete the assignments, ensuring a thorough learning\u00a0experience.",
